Crude steel is defined as steel in its first solid (or usable) form: ingots, semi-finished products (billets, blooms, slabs), and
liquid steel for castings. This is not to be confused with liquid steel, which is steel poured.
Hot rolled (hr) products (hr long products, hr flat products, seamless tubes) are products of first transformation. These
products may be further worked to produce cold rolled-, coated-, and tubular products (except seamless tubes).
